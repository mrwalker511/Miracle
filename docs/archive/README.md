## Why Archived?

These files were archived during the progressive disclosure refactoring:

1. **Consolidation**: Content merged into focused topic files
2. **Contradictions**: Some contained conflicting information
3. **Redundancy**: Information duplicated across multiple files
4. **Maintainability**: Monolithic docs harder to keep current
5. **Discoverability**: Topic-based structure easier to navigate
